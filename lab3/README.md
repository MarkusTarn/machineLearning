# LAB 3
## Localized search with minimizing hill climbing algorithm

### Description:
Purpose for this lab was to familiarize with minimizing hill climbing algorithm.

I wrote an algorithm for moving queens on chessboard so that no two queens share line of sight.

* Generating queens was done pseudo-randomly: every column would get at least one queen placed on random row. 
Queens are just (`x`, `y`) coordinates saved as tuples and stored in a list.

* Hill climbing algorithm will evaluate the board based on number of conflicts (in our case).
Each conflict (pair of queens that share line of sight) will add +1 to position value.
It will then move queens one-by-one to the tile with minimum value (least conflicts).

* When it reaches plateau (can only find moves with similar value) without finding best possible outcome (`0`),
it will generate mutation by dislocating one queen to random row.

* When best possible solution is found or all mutations (100 by default) are used up,
method will return the best value it could find.



### Instructions to run:
1. Create Position object with (Number of tiles in row) as argument.
2. Run the hill_climbing method with Position object as argument.

Default number of possible mutations is 100, if you want to change it, then enter it
as second optional argument for hill_climbing(queens, mutations).
### Example:
```
position = NQPosition(20)
print("Final value:", hill_climbing(position))
position.print_board()
```

### output:
```
Number of queens: 20
Initial position value: 26
Time spent: 8 seconds
Final value: 0
Final board:
